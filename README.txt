A Time-Evolving-Graph (TEG) is a sequence of graphs generated from an univariate time series.

The ``tegdet`` library includes a set anomaly detectors which rely on TEGs both for the generation 
of the *prediction model*, from a *training dataset*, and for the *prediction of ouliers*, from  *testing datasets*.

The library depends on the Python packages: ``pandas``, ``scipy``.
